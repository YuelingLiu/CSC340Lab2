# CSC340Lab2- Implemeting a few stand-alone functions to manipulate string obejcts
This assginement include following five functions to analyze or revise this sample string in this project:
  1) Implement the GetNumOfNonWSCharacters() function. GetNumOfNonWSCharacters() has one in-parameter that should be declared as constant and passed in by reference.
  2) Implement the FindText() function, which has two in-parameters, both are strings. Let's say we are going to find a needle in a haystack. The first parameter represents the needle, and the second parameter the haystack. 
  3) Implement the ReplaceExclamation() function. ReplaceExclamation() has a string parameter and updates the string by replacing each '!' character in the string with a '.' character.
  4) Implement the ShortenSpace() function. ShortenSpace() has a string parameter and updates the string by replacing all sequences of 2 or more spaces with a single space. ShortenSpace() DOES NOT return the revised string. It returns void instead. Same as the above function, the parameter is the in/out type.
  5)  Implement the GetNumOfWords() function. GetNumOfWords() has one in-parameter that should be declared as constant and passed in by reference.
  6)  implement a UserInteraction() function, which produces a menu of user options as below:
  
MENU

c - Number of non-whitespace characters

w - Number of words

f - Find text

r - Replace all !'s

s - Shorten spaces

q - Quit
